=================

http://github.com/julen/django-socialdict

socialdict is a django app that retrieves terms from microblogging sites and stores and displays them as a simple dictionary.

Currently terms can only be retrieved from a single backed, although support for multiple sites is planned.

Installation
------------

* Add 'socialdict' to your INSTALLED_APPS and sync your database.
* In your project settings file you need to add the following settings:
SOCIAL_URL : the URL string to perform the search
SOCIAL_HASHTAG : the hashtag that will be used to retrieve terms.
* Include socialdict.urls within your project's URL structure.
* To retrieve terms you need to setup a cron job that calls the socialdict/bin/update_terms.py. You can also run this script from the command line.

How it w orks
-------------

Terms are retrieved based on a certain hashtag and there is a parser that defines what goes in and what goes out. Currently entries that contain URLs or the at-sign are discarded, since they can lead to false positives. The hastag is deleted and a colon character splits the term and the meaning.

So the pattern to follow is:
TERM: meaning #hashtag
